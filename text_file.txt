Sensors play a crucial role in our increasingly interconnected world, enabling the collection of data that drives numerous technological advancements and improves our daily lives. These devices are designed to detect and respond to physical, chemical, or environmental stimuli, converting them into measurable signals or data for analysis.

There are various types of sensors available, each serving a specific purpose. For instance, temperature sensors monitor changes in temperature and are used in weather forecasting, HVAC systems, and industrial processes. Pressure sensors detect changes in pressure and are utilized in applications such as automotive systems, medical devices, and aerospace engineering.

Another commonly used sensor type is the proximity sensor, which detects the presence or absence of objects within a certain range. Proximity sensors are found in smartphones, automatic doors, and robotics, enabling touchless interactions and enhanced safety.
